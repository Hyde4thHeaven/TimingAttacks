## Welcome to GitHub Pages

The most common string comparison in Python programming is **==**. 

However, when you coding as **a == b**, if a and b are of different lengths, or if an error occurs, a timing attack could theoretically reveal information about the types and lengths of a and b—but not their values.

To reduce the vulnerability to timing attacks, it is recommended to use the **compare_digest()** function instead **==** operator.
